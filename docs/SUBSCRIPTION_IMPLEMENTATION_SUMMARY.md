## Implementation Notes

### Security Considerations

- Apple shared secret is currently a placeholder and should be securely stored in production
- Google Play purchase validation should be done server-side for security
- User authentication is required for subscription syncing with Supabase

### Technical Debt

- The receipt validation for Apple is currently done client-side, which is not ideal for security
- The subscription verification method in SubscriptionSyncService is a placeholder and needs implementation

## Next Steps

1. Complete the store configuration in App Store Connect and Google Play Console
2. Implement server-side receipt validation for enhanced security
3. Test the subscription flow on both iOS and Android devices
4. Apply subscription gating throughout the app for premium features
5. Add analytics to track subscription conversions and churn
