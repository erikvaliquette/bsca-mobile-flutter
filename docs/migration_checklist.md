## Completion Criteria

Each feature should meet the following criteria before being considered complete:

1. **Functional Parity**: Feature works the same as in the React Native app
2. **UI/UX Consistency**: Visual appearance matches the original design
3. **Performance**: Feature performs at least as well as the React Native version
4. **Testing**: Feature has appropriate unit, widget, and integration tests
5. **Documentation**: Code is well-documented with comments and README updates
