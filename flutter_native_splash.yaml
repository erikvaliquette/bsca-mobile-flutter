flutter_native_splash:
  # Background color of the splash screen
  color: "#FFFFFF"
  
  # You can also use a background image instead of a solid color
  # background_image: "assets/images/background.png"
  
  # Image to be displayed in the center of the splash screen
  image: assets/images/logo/app_logo.png
  
  # Splash screen will remain until flutter has fully rendered the first frame
  # This is the recommended approach
  android_12:
    # The image parameter sets the splash screen icon image
    image: assets/images/logo/app_logo.png
    
    # The color parameter sets the background color
    color: "#FFFFFF"
    
    # The icon_background_color parameter sets the background color for the app icon
    icon_background_color: "#FFFFFF"

  # Splash screen will remain for a fixed time (milliseconds)
  # This is an alternative approach if you want more control
  # android_screen_orientation: portrait
  # fullscreen: true

  # iOS configuration
  ios: true
  
  # Web configuration (optional)
